# Traveling_Salesman_Problem
Team #1's code for Traveling Salesman Problem | Based on Topic in IT III Course, Ritsumei, 2018.

We get an approximate result for TSP problem by using **Genetic Algorithm**, with **Python programming environment**.

Specially, we use **Roulette Wheel Selection** method for our *Selection*, and optimized *Breed process* with **Partly best** method.

City data was stored in `data`, you can add your fomatted input in this area.

All Slides and Exercises can be find in [Topics in IT-III (K1, AD)](http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~gulliver/it3/)
